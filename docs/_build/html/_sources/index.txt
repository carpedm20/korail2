ndrive manual
=============

Introduction
------------

*ndrive* is a python library that can provide an access to Naver Ndrive. This is not an official Ndrive python API, so some features may not be implemented, yet.

    >>> from ndrive import Ndrive
    >>> nd = Ndrive()
    >>> nd.login("YOUR_ID","YOUR_PASSWORD")
    >>> nd.uploadFile("test.txt",'/test.txt',True)


Key Features
------------

* Download and upload a file
* Get file and directory list of Ndrive directories
* Make a url share link for a specific directory or file
* Search Ndrive file and  directory
* Get properties of file and directory


Installation
------------

This package is available in PyPI. To install it in your system, use easy_install::

    $ easy_install ndrive

Or use pip::

    $ pip install ndrive

Or check out developement version::

    $ git clone git://github.com/carpedm20/ndrive.git


Quick Start
-----------

If you want to start with Ndrive module, you need to *login* to Ndrive first. Just make a ``Ndrive`` object and use ``login`` method.

Login::

    nd = Ndrive()
    nd.login("YOUR_ID","YOUR_PASSWORD")


Then you might want to *download* a file from your Ndrive, but you might don't know exact filename in Ndrive directory. Then, you can use ``getList`` method to *get list* of files and directory of given directory.

*Don't forget to put / in front of the Ndrive path, which indicate root directory of Ndrive*

Get file and directory List::

    nd_list = nd.getList('/', type=3)
    print nd_list

If you find a file, then you can download the file to your local directory.

Download::

    nd.download('/Picture/flower.png', './flower.png')

Or you can upload a file::

    nd.puloadFile('./flower.png','/Picture/flower.png')

You can make a test directory at root directory::

    nd.makeDirectory('/test')

and move a file from root to a created test directory::

    nd.doMove('/flower.png','/test/flower.png')
